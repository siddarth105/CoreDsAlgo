Abstract Class – Default Implementation
Eg:- HttpsServlet is an abstract class because developers do not need to implement all service methods.
For the methods that the developer does not provide implementation, the default implementation is taken care.
If your servlet is required to handle doGet () requests for example, there is no need to write a doPost () method too
